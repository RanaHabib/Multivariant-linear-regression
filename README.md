# Multivariant-linear-regression

Generate 1000 linear samples that follow the following equation: 

Y = 5X1 + 3X2 + 1.5X3 + 6

`Hint:` generate the X's randomly.

Use built-in function to split the data to (Train & Test).

**Implement** **Loss** & gradient Decent functions.

**Print** the final weights & Accuracy.

Use the Housing Price dataset.
